Hi, I'm Mel. I mainly use she/they, but any pronouns are fine. I live in Kentucky with my husband and our corgi.

Right now, making TikToks about books and fanfic is sort of my main thing. Am I uniquely qualified to do that? Nope. I have a BFA in Studio Art, and at my day job I design software.

When I'm not reading or making videos about reading, I like to write, cook, garden, go on long and easy hikes, drink craft beer, thrift for clothes, and talk through movies.
